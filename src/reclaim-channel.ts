/**
 * Which Reclaim delivery channel carries a verification. Ported from Lock-in, where it was written but
 * never wired; Viky's session route passes both option sets to the SDK, so the channel is a setting.
 *
 * This is a product decision, not a technical detail, so it is a setting rather than a hardcoded call:
 *
 * - `portal` (the SDK default) runs the verification in a REMOTE browser. The user's own Duolingo or
 *   Strava session is never used, so they authenticate again inside that remote browser on every
 *   check-in.
 * - `app` hands the flow to the Reclaim Verifier on the user's device, where a session can persist
 *   between check-ins.
 *
 * Nothing here asserts that either channel persists a login: that is exactly what has to be measured
 * before the product opens to users (spike S1). Cookie-retention policy (`isRecurring`,
 * `canClearWebStorage`) lives in the Reclaim application configuration and the InApp SDK, not in this
 * web SDK, so it cannot be set from here and must be confirmed on the Reclaim dashboard.
